# ARBook
AR Unity Project
This project is an augumented reality project that shows a 3d model in the real world through the help of an apk on the phone. The project was made by adding an a4 image of a character,tracking it, adding a model from the asset store to appear when the a4 sheet(in real life is shown in-front of the camera. The project(ArBook) has multiple images of basic drawings from which 3d models that represent the drawing would appear.
